# Create transactions via plugin

When implementing via plugin, is possible to send as a parameter a prefix, meaning that all the routes inside this plugin will start with this prefix. In the example, it will be transactions.

## Changing the server.ts

```js
app.register(transactionsRoutes, {
    prefix: 'transactions',
})
```

## Endpoint to Create a new Transaction

We will use `zod` to create the Schema for the transaction route based on the `request.body` information that the user will send.
On `transactions.ts` file:

```js
import { FastifyInstance } from 'fastify'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { randomUUID } from 'node:crypto'
import { knex } from '../database'

export async function transactionsRoutes(app: FastifyInstance) {
    app.post('/', async (request, reply) => {
        const createTransactionBodySchema = z.object({
            title: z.string(),
            amount: z.number(),
            type: z.enum(['deposit', 'withdrawal']),
        })

        const { title, amount, type } = createTransactionBodySchema.parse(request.body)

        await knex('transactions')
            .insert({
                id: randomUUID(),
                title,
                amount: type === 'deposit' ? amount : amount * -1,
            })

        return reply.status(201).send()
    })
}
```

At the end, we are using `parse` method to confirm if the body is equal to the schema created to validate the request content.

By multiplying with -1, this means that the value will be negative and when sum the total it will actually reflect the correct balance.

Note: Similar to `response`, the use of `reply` comes from Fastify.

Remember to configure the route on Insomnia or similar:

Method: POST
URL: `http://localhost:3333/transactions`
Example JSON - Body

```json
{
    "title": "Freelancer",
    "amount": 8000,
    "type": "deposit"
}
```

After submitting, it should receive a 201 Response from the server.
