# ESLint

Create a pattern to the project.

To install ESLint - and add a setup configuration made by Rocketseat:

```bash
npm i eslint @rocketseat/eslint-config -D
```

To use the configuration made by Rocketseat, it's necessary to create a file `.eslintrc.json` and add:

```json
{
    "extends": [
        "@rocketseat/eslint-config/node"
    ]
}
```

Note: make sure you have the ESLint extension installed!

To configure the preferences on VS Code, go to command+shift+p and search for `settings` the option: **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**. When opening the `settings.json` file, look for **editor.codeActionsOnSave**:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true,
},
```

After saving a file, the ESLint will update the formatting.

To facilitate, create a `lint` script inside `package.json` file:

```json
"lint": "eslint src --ext .ts --fix"
```

After that, when running `npm run lint` it should list the errors identified that were not able to fix and automatically fix the ones that are straight forward.
