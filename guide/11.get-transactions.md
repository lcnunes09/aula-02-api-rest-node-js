# List Transactions

Creating the endpoint to list transactions.

On `transactions.ts` file:

```js
app.get('', async () => {
    const transactions = await knex('transactions').select()

    return {
        transactions
    }
})
```

Note: Returning transactions as an object will help to add other information in the future.

In order to test the GET endpoint to list all transactions, configure the route on Insomnia or similar:

Method: GET
URL: `http://localhost:3333/transactions`
No Body

By submitting, you should see all existing transactions.

## List a specific transaction via id

In order to list a specific transaction via id, create a GET route on `transactios.ts` file:

```js
app.get('/:id', async (request) => {
    const getTransactionParamsSchema = z.object({
        id: z.string().uuid(),
    })

    const { id } = getTransactionParamsSchema.parse(request.params)

    const transaction = await knex('transactions').where('id', id).first()

    return {
        transaction
    }
})
```

The `first` parameter sent is to get the first (and only) result that is represented by the id.

Note: The use of zod library helps to create a schema and validate the request params and confirming that existing id into the database.

In order to test the GET endpoint to list a **specific transaction**, use the same GET method, but add the ID into the URL, as a query param.

Method: GET
URL: `http://localhost:3333/transactions/91093abf-e433-43d9-ad52-e4a9f2ce0d4c`
No Body

By submitting, you should see the transaction referenced by the ID sent.
