# Using Cookies in Fastify

First, it is necessary to install a library `cookie` from Fastify:

```bash
npm i @fastify/cookie
```

In the `server.ts` file, **before the routes are declared**, it's necessary to register the cookie plugin.

```js
import cookie from '@fastify/cookie'

...

app.register(cookie)
```

Back to the `transactions.ts` file, modify the POST method to add the cookie, before inserting the information into the database:

```js

let sessionId = request.cookies.sessionId

if (!sessionId) {
    sessionId = randomUUID()

    reply.cookie('sessionId', sessionId, {
        path: '/',
        maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 7 days
    })
}

await knex('transactions').insert({
    id: randomUUID(),
    title,
    amount: type === 'deposit' ? amount : amount * -1,
    session_id = sessionId
})

```

Cookie parameters:
Path - determine which route will be able to access this information. In this case, '/' means any route.
Expires - all cookies must expire sometime. By using `expires`, it's necessary to specify exactly the date and time that the cookie will expire. A better alternative is using `maxAge`, meaning that how long in milliseconds this cookie will be in the user browser. For a better clean code, use the multiply math function to be specific of how long it will take and add a comment to say how long it's expected. It's easier to maintain the code to change from 7 to 20 if a change needs to be made instead of calculating the information all over.

In order to see the cookie saved, submit a transaction via POST and check the Cookie tab on Insomnia.

By listing the transactions, it's possible to see the session ID saved on the last created transaction.

By doing this way, the cookie is sent automatically, it's not necessary to send via parameter to save the information. This will help to identify who is using the application when there's no user authentication.
