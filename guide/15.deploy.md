# Deploy application

First and foremost, in order for the deployment platform to understand the TypeScript code, it's necessary to convert it to JavaScript.

There is a tool that do this for us: `tsup` (that uses `esbuild`).

**Faster Bundling**: `esbuild` is known for its extremely fast bundling speed. It can bundle TypeScript code into JavaScript very quickly, which can significantly reduce build times, especially for large projects.

**Smaller Bundle Sizes**: `esbuild` generates highly optimized and smaller bundle sizes compared to some other bundlers. This can result in faster page load times for your web applications.

**Easy to Configure**: `tsup` simplifies the bundling process and provides a minimal configuration approach, making it easier to set up and use, especially for smaller projects or when you want a quick and straightforward build process.

**Tree Shaking**: `esbuild` has excellent tree shaking capabilities. It can eliminate unused code from your bundles, resulting in smaller output files.

**Support for TypeScript**: Both `tsup` and `esbuild` have strong support for TypeScript, so you can write your code in TypeScript without any issues.

**CommonJS and ES Modules**: esbuild can generate both CommonJS and ES module outputs, which makes it versatile and compatible with various JavaScript environments.

To install as a development dependency:

```bash
npm i tsup -D
```

Create a script into `package.json` file:

```json
"build": "tsup src --out-dir build"
```

To run the `build`: 

```bash
npm run build
```

After running the code, it will be created a `build` folder that has all the code in javascript.

It's necessary to guarantee that the code is working when running: 

```bash
node build/server.js
```

## Build Code Ehhncement

Since the code is in JavaScript, we need to make sure the eslint is ignoring the `build` folder. To do that, create a file `.eslintignore`:

```text
node_modules
build
```

**IMPORTANT**: the `build` folder needs to be added into the `.gitignore` file.

## Enhancing the .gitignore file

It's good to start to categorize the .gitignore file, adding comments.

```text
# Dependencies
node_modules

# Database
db/*.db

# Environment
.env
.env.test

# Build
build
```

## Send your code to GitHub

Note: Make sure to initiate Git and commit your code first, if you haven't already. It's important to make small commits as you develop your application.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Using [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), you can log in using:

```bash
gh repo create
```

You will choose the option: `Push an existing local repository to GitHub`.
If you are executing the command under your project folder, the `Path to local repository` should be (.) as default.
Choose the Repository name and owner, description, visibility, `Add a remote` should be Y, so we are able to make `git push`, name of the remote can be the default `origin` and you can push the commits made previously into GitHub.

To check the repo via the browser, you can run the command:

```bash
gh repo view -w
```

## Deploy platforms

Some examples:

- [render](render.com)
- [fly.io](fly.io)
- [Railway](railway.app)

It's important to notice that you can start to use a free tool, but eventually you will need a paid tool.

For this example, we will use Render.

### Create database on your render account

After creating your account on render, create a Postgres database.

- Choose a unique name for your database
-
