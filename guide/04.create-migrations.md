# Migrations

Migrations are a concept commonly used in software development, particularly in the context of databases. They refer to a set of techniques that allow developers to manage changes to the structure or schema of a database in a systematic and organized way. Migrations ensure that as a project evolves, changes to the database schema can be tracked, versioned, and applied in a consistent manner across different environments.

## Configure migrations

To configure the migrations, we will need to change the database configuration and create the `knexfile.ts` in the root of your application that is conventionally used.

Changes on `database.ts` file to have a variable that has only the database configuration:

```typescript
import { knex as setupKnex, Knex } from 'knex'

export const config: Knex.Config = {
    client: 'sqlite',
    connection: {
        filename: './db/app.db',
    },
    useNullAsDefault: true,
    migrations: {
        extension: 'ts',
        directory: './db/migrations', 
    }
}

export const knex = setupKnex(config)
```

Note: Using `Knex.Config` it will allow to use the Knex Interface, meaning that it will be able to auto complete by typing command+space.

On the `knexfile.ts`:

```typescript
import { config } from './src/database'

export default config
```

In order to run the code using `tsx`, since is not a default way that `knex` works, it will be necessary to create a new script on the `package.json` file:

```json
"knex": "node --no-warnings --loader tsx ./node_modules/.bin/knex"
```

Note: -- -h will show the possible commands that can be used with `knex`.

```bash
npm run knex -- -h
```

To create the migrations:

```bash
npm run knex -- migrate:make create-documents
```

After running the migrate command, a new `migrations` folder will be created as well as the first migration file.
