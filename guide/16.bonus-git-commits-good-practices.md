# Git Commits

- Use a clear and concise commit message. The message should be descriptive enough to understand what the commit does, but it should also be short enough to be easily readable.
- Use the conventional commits: <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/> style for your commit messages. This style uses a standard format for the commit message, which makes it easier to understand and track changes.
- Use the `chore`, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, and `revert` commit types. These types are defined by the conventional commits style, and they help to categorize the changes made in the commit.
- Include a link to the relevant issue or pull request in the commit message. This helps to track the progress of development and makes it easier to find the relevant information.
- Sign off your commits. This can be done by adding Signed-off-by: YOUR_NAME to the end of the commit message. This helps to verify that you have reviewed the commit and that you agree with the changes.

Here are some examples of commit messages:

`chore: update dependencies`
`feat: add new feature`
`fix: bug fix`
`docs: update documentation`
`style: improve formatting`
`refactor: refactor code`
`perf: improve performance`
`test: add new tests`
`revert: revert previous commit`

By following these good practices, you can write Git commits that are clear, concise, and easy to understand. This will help to improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

Some additional tips:

- Avoid using all caps or excessive punctuation in your commit messages.
- Use consistent formatting for your commit messages.
- Keep your commit messages short and to the point.
- Avoid adding personal opinions or irrelevant information to your commit messages.
- Be specific about what changes were made in the commit.
- Avoid using vague or ambiguous language in your commit messages.
